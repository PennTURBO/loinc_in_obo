## Many core analyte patterns haven't been axiomitized yet



### Here are some patterns

"cells."… with 2+ markers, including negatives

- cells.cd19+cd38+igm+
- cells.cd27+igd-igm-

CD59 deficient cells

- erythrocytes.cd59 deficient
- granulocytes.cd59 deficient

Cells with various differentia

- epithelial cells.non-squamous
- epithelial cells.renal
- erythrocytes.cd59 deficient
- erythrocytes.nucleated
- granulocytes.cd59 deficient
- granulocytes.immature

cytochrome P450 variants

- cyp2c19 gene allele
- cyp2c9 gene allele 2

Mutant host genes

- f5 gene.p.arg506gln
- fmr1 gene allele N.cgg repeat (where N is an integer from 1 to ?)
- hbb gene.c.19g>a
- cftr gene.p.asp1152his

Cytology

- t(15;17)(q24.1;q21.1)(pml,rara)
- t(8;21)(q22;q22.3)(runx1t1,runx1)

Microbial genes

- hepatitis c virus ns5 gene
- hiv 1 integrase gene

Proteins with tissue-specific forms… not yet sure how this is different from specifying the LOINC system part of the assay

- amylase.pancreatic
- amylase.salivary
- albumin.csf

Elements by covalent binding partner (and/or oxidation state?)

- arsenic.methylated
- arsenic.organic

Chemicals in free vs bound states

- bilirubin.albumin bound
- bilirubin.glucuronidated+bilirubin.albumin bound
- cholesterol.in hdl 3
- cholesterol.in idl+cholesterol.in vldl 3
- cholesterol.in vldl 3
- cholesterol.non hdl

Subunits… this example also seems to embed the intent of an assay into the core analyte

- choriogonadotropin.beta subunit
- choriogonadotropin.intact+beta subunit
- choriogonadotropin.beta subunit (pregnancy test)

Coagulation studies that I don't understand yet

- coagulation factor.extrinsic pathway
- coagulation surface induced.factor substitution
- coagulation surface induced.inhibitor sensitive
- coagulation surface induced.lupus sensitive

Semi-specific fatty acids

- fatty acids.nonesterified

- Fatty acids.very long chain C22:0 (Docosanoate)

- Fatty acids.very long chain pattern

- fatty acids.very long chain.c24:0

  

## Ungrouped patterns

creatine kinase.mb

creatine kinase.mm

 

immunoglobulin light chains.kappa

immunoglobulin light chains.kappa.free

 

interleukin 2 receptor.soluble

 

lipoprotein.beta.subparticle

lipoprotein.beta.subparticle.intermediate

lipoprotein.beta.subparticle.small

lipoprotein.pre-beta.subparticle.large

 

neutrophils.band form

neutrophils.hypersegmented

 

platelet aggregation.adenosine diphosphate induced

platelet aggregation.arachidonate induced

 

prostate specific ag.free

prostate specific ag.protein bound

 

testosterone.free+weakly bound



the presnece of the words "free" or "total" could indicate an analyte with a divisor



## Patterns that ahve been well-characterized

 

Have already generated some X+Y axioms, like oxycodone+oxymorphone

Have already generated some cells with a single marked examples, like CD20+
